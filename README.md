SnrCalculator
=========
The program SnrCalculator allows determining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of pulsed EPR dipolar spectroscopy (PDS) signals. In this program, SNR is defined as a ratio between the modulation depth of a PDS time trace and the standard deviation of noise. To extract the noise contribution from the PDS signal, the PDS time trace is interpolated using the Savitzky-Golay filter and then the result of the interpolation is subtracted from the original signal.

General Information
=========
The source code of the program is written in Python 3.7 using the libraries numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PyQt-5 and pyqt5-tools.

The Windows and Linux executables of the program are provided at:

The user guide of the program will be published shortly.
